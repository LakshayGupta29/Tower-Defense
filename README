Hello,
This repositary contains a basic tower defense game

### Grid-Based Building System:
• The game has a grid where you can place buildings during the building phase
• Two types of defensive buildings:
  • **Cannon**: Medium range, medium damage
  • **Archer Tower**: Longer range, lower damage but faster firing

### Offensive Units:
• Two types of troops you can deploy during the battle phase:
  • **Warriors**: Melee units with high health
  • **Archers**: Ranged units with lower health but can attack from a distance

### Game Phases:
1. Building Phase: Place defensive structures on the grid
2. Battle Phase: Deploy troops to attack the defenses

### Resources:
• **Gold**: Used primarily for buildings
• **Elixir**: Used primarily for troops
• Earn resources by defeating enemy troops

## How to Play:

1. Building Phase:
   • Click on a building type in the sidebar
   • Click on the grid to place the selected building
   • Click "Start Battle" when ready

2. Battle Phase:
   • Select a troop type from the sidebar
   • Click on the edges of the map to deploy troops
   • Troops will automatically target and attack the nearest building
   • Defenses will automatically target and attack troops in range

3. Victory/Defeat:
   • Win by destroying all buildings
   • Lose if all your troops die and you can't afford more

Hope you enjoy playing this game :P
